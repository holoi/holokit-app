# TypedRealityTheRain

TypedRealityTheRain creates an Stereo-AR experience where a white cloud, styled like typography, follows the player(person in camera in Screen-AR mode), continuously dropping raindrops. These raindrops collide with the real-world ground, splitting and fading away.

In this reality, we use 3DBodyTracking Feature to track a person in camera in Screen-AR mode. In Stereo-AR mode, the cloud follows the player.

***Customization:***

Object “The Rain” controls the visual of cloud. Object “Text Rain” under “The Rain” controls the visual of raindrops.

Feel free to adjust properties of VFX components of “The Rain” and “Text Rain” to create sth new.
